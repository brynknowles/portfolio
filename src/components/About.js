            <hr></hr>
            <p>Iâ€™m a Software Engineer specializing in React, JavaScript and Ruby on Rails. I have a passion for learning new languages and technologies and using those skills to build useful and engaging software applications. The constantly shifting world of technology and its limitless potential to help make the world a better place are part of why I'm so excited to be a software engineer.</p>
            <p>To me, coding is the perfect coalescence of my artistic/designer side--the visionary that creates tangible experiences from ideas, and my engineering mindset--the researcher who solves problems, organizes and makes things more efficient. I am very much looking forward to working with a team to build software that lifts up, educates and empowers people.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me playing in the dirt outside with my wonderful and very energetic 4.5yr old, walking my dog, exercising and spending a lot of quality time in nature with friends and family.</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p>Technical Skills: JavaScript, React/React Hooks, Ruby/Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS --replace with icons!</p>
