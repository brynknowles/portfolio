            <hr></hr>
            <p>Hello!</p>
            <p>I’m a Software Engineer specializing in React, JavaScript and Ruby on Rails. I have a passion for learning new languages and technologies and using those skills to build useful and engaging software applications. The constantly shifting world of technology and its limitless potential to help make the world a better place are part of why I'm so excited to be a software engineer.</p>

            <p>Before coding, I worked as a landscape designer in the SF Bay Area. Landscape design is a very visually and mentally rewarding job. It's a great example of how an idea in your head can be put on paper, transferred to a computer, and then be used to build something. My job in this field involved using my creativity to solve problems, and I loved the challenge.</p>

            <p>When my child was born in 2016 I became a stay-at-home parent. My child has taught me a lot, but some of the most important takeaways for me are that it's important to encourage people to be empathetic, honor their true selves and follow their dreams. My desire to provide a better life for my child and family, and follow my own lifelong dream is why I took the leap and decided to pursue a career in tech.</p>

            <p>Fast forward to today and I’m still solving problems--but instead of designing landscapes, I’m designing web applications. As a graduate from the Flatiron School's SE program, I’m continuing my education by taking online courses, learning new technologies and keeping my skills sharp. I'm also continually working on developing software applications, as well as participating in hackathons and pair-programming with friends.</p>

            <p>To me, coding is the perfect coalescence of my artistic/designer side--the visionary that creates tangible experiences from ideas, and my engineering mindset--the researcher who solves problems, organizes and makes things more efficient. I am very much looking forward to working with a team to build software that lifts up, educates and empowers people.</p>

            <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me playing in the dirt outside with my wonderful and very energetic 4.5yr old, walking my dog, exercising and spending a lot of quality time in nature with friends and family.</p>
